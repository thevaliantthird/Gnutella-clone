Coverity is a static code checker.

The gtk-gnutella project is at:

	https://scan.coverity.com/projects/2178

To build gtk-gnutella for analysis, one needs to first download the
necessary binaries for the platform, and install them say in /usr/local.
As of this writing, this is:

	/usr/local/cov-analysis-linux64-7.0.2

here on my machine.  Let's call this COV.

Add COV/bin to your PATH.

Configure your C compiler, for instance:

	cov-configure --compiler /usr/bin/cc --comptype gcc

In the src/ directory run:

	make coverity.tgz

Upload the generated coverity.tgz file to the Coverity scanner, which is
available through the URL of the project mentionned above (one has to login
first).

The file src/coverity.c is a model for the Converity scanner which teaches
it basic things about some key functions, for the runtime analyzing the code
paths.  The scanner may be able to automatically derive some of the properties
from gcc attribute hints, but maybe not, so we're helping it.

The src/coverity.c file has to be manually uploaded to the Coverity scanner,
it is not automatically picked from the source tree.
