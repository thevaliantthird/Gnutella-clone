Here are the changes since 0.95.3, as listed in the ChangeLog:

  only the last byte needed to be downloaded, has been fixed.
- Preliminary browse-host support, allowing other servents to browse
  the files that are shared. This is disabled by default.
- GTKG will detect online status again after temporary network failure.
- The .desktop file and application icons are now properly installed.
- Downloads are now sorting in a more logical way.
- Bug fixes in UTF-8 support.
- Doxygen documentation updates.
- Japanese and Spanish translation updates.


Enjoy!
