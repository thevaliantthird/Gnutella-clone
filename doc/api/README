This directory contains the configuration file for Doxygen used to
generate various formatted documents.

Required Installation
---------------------

First of all, you can download a decent package from:

        http://www.doxygen.org/

Recommendation
--------------

You also might want to install dot, a part of Graph Visualization
Software distributed by AT&T. If you installed it and enabled some
lines YES in the configuration file, as a clickable image, interesting
graph from source code is generated at the same time.

The URL is:

        http://www.graphviz.org/

To Generate a Document
----------------------

You can simply type:

        $ doxygen gtkg-apidoc.cfg

in this directory. Note that only HTML documents are generated by
default. If you want to know what kinds of output formats are available,
take a look at the configuration file and see below.

Important
---------

If you have set both of HAVE_DOT and CALL_GRAPH to YES using a low-end
machine, the process takes much more time, especially if you are
trying to generate not only HTML but also LaTeX and MAN Pages.
In my experiences, generated LaTeX files are great eater of disk
space. The following is a result of my case (IRIX 6.5, MIPS R10000
250MHz, RAM 384MB):

  - The peak memory usage is about 80MB (70MB constantly).
  - The disk space consumption is over 90MB (only HTML, in passing,
    entire size of gtk-gnutella source code is about 17MB).
  - Total spending time is about 10 hours.

In contrast, if you disable HAVE_DOT and CALL_GRAPH the complete
process takes at most a few minutes.

So, consult your machine firstly before making tons of file absurdly.

For Developers
--------------

See also section 2.2 of STYLE file in the doc/devguide directory.
It's pleasant if you have doxygen-aware commenting :-)

You can edit the contents of the gtkg-apidoc.main file, which becomes
the front page later, as you like but you have to use the proper format.
