The 'HNAME' GGEP Extension
==========================

Name: HNAME
Where: Query Hit trailer
Status: Production
Date: Sun Oct 26 20:08:29 MET 2003
Format: <string>
COBS-Encoding: Never
Deflate: Maybe

The 'HNAME' extension is a standard extension that carries the servent's
host name.  It appears in the extension trailer of the Query Hits.

Servents should ask their users whether they want to advertise a symbolic
hostname, for instance "foo.example.com".  This will enable the readers
of query hits to contact back the servent in case it has a dynamic IP, but
where the symbolic hostname always resolves to the current IP address.

The payload format is a single string, without the trailing NUL.

The payload is never COBS-encoded, but may be deflated if really long.
