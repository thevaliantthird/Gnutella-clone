The 'PRU' GGEP Extension

Status: Production

The "PRU' extension is used in query hits to indicate that the result entry
is only partially available.  This is in response to queries holding the "PR"
GGEP extension to indicate that they are ready to accept partial results.

The payload of the PRU extension can be empty (legacy servents only) or
will contain a binary concatenation of two values:

- A 4-byte timestamp, big-endian encoding.  This is the amount of seconds
  since the UNIX Epoch, indicating the last time data was received for this
  file by the servent.

- A variable file size encoded like the GGEP "LF" extension and giving the
  amount of bytes available for the file.  This will be between 0 and 8-byte
  long and is simply a little-endian encoding with trailing zeroes stripped.
