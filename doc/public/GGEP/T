The 'T' GGEP Extension

This GGEP extension is used together with GGEP 'A'. Each set bit
indicates that the corresponding hosts listed in the GGEP 'A' block
supports TLS.  The first byte refers to first 8 peer addresses, the
second byte to next 8 hosts and so on. Trailing zeros may be omitted.
The bits are mapped to the hosts from MSB to LSB. The following code
fragment shows how to read GGEP 'T':

  for (i = 0; i < hosts.length; i++) {
    unsigned mask, byte;

    byte = i >> 3;
    mask = 0x80U >> (i & 7);
    if (byte >= T.length)
      break;
    hosts.address[i].supports_tls = 0 != (T.payload[byte] & mask);
  }
