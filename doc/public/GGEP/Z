The 'Z' extension is an indication to the receiving ultrapeer that the
issuer of the query supports the Gnutella UDP Traffic Compression.

The ultrapeer, before relaying the query hit to the querier can then
compress the message on the fly before sending it, provided the compressed
form is smaller than the original of course.
