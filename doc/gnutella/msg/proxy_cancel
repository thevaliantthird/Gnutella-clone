DESCRIPTION

This message carries no payload.  It is sent by a servent which no
longer wishes to have the target node be its push-proxy.  This
indicates to the recipient that the sending node has determined that
it was no longer TCP-firewalled.

Due to its nature, the GTKG/21v1 message is sent unsolicited to
registered push-proxies, whether or not they advertised support for it..
